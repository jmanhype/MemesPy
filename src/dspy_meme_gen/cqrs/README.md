# Event Sourcing & CQRS Architecture for MemesPy

## Overview

This architecture replaces the current mutable state approach with an event-sourced, CQRS-based system that provides:

- **Immutability**: All state changes are captured as immutable events
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Scalability**: Efficient handling of millions of events
- **Flexibility**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance

## Architecture Components

### 1. Event Store
- Immutable append-only log of all domain events
- Optimized for sequential writes
- Supports event replay and snapshots

### 2. Command Side (Write Model)
- Processes commands and emits events
- Validates business rules
- Maintains consistency

### 3. Query Side (Read Model)
- Optimized projections for different use cases
- Eventually consistent views
- Denormalized for performance

### 4. Event Bus
- Distributes events to projections
- Supports async processing
- Enables system decoupling

## Key Benefits

1. **Audit Trail**: Every change is tracked with who, what, when, why
2. **Time Travel**: Replay events to any point in time
3. **Performance**: Optimized read/write paths
4. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of read/write sides
5. **Resilience**: Event replay enables recovery from failures

## Migration Strategy

The migration follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Event capture alongside existing system
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual projection migration
3. **Phase 3**: Command handling migration
4. **Phase 4**: Legacy system decommission
