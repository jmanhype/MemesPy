## Setup and Running

- API docs available via `/docs` (Swagger UI).

## Current Implementation Status (Phase 1 Findings)

- **Entry Point:** The primary functional entry point appears to be `src/dspy_meme_gen/api/main.py`, which uses FastAPI routers. An alternative `src/dspy_meme_gen/api/final_app.py` exists but seems less structured and also uses placeholder logic.
- **Core AI Functionality:** Contrary to the initial feature list implying active AI generation, the core components responsible for meme text (`MemePredictor`) and image generation (`ImageGenerator`) within `src/dspy_meme_gen/dspy_modules/` are **currently implemented as placeholders**. They return random predefined text and image URLs, respectively, and do not utilize DSPy or external APIs (like OpenAI/DALL-E) for the main generation flow accessed via the API.
- **Configuration:** Uses Pydantic BaseSettings (`src/dspy_meme_gen/config/config.py`) loading from `.env`.
- **Database & Caching:** Standard SQLAlchemy setup for DB persistence and Redis for caching are present and used by the API endpoints.
- **Conclusion:** The project provides the structure for an AI meme generator but the core AI generation logic is not yet implemented in the main operational path. Running the application will result in placeholder content being served.
